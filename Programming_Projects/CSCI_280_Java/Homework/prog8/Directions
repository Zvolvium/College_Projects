Program# 2
The Java class called Holiday is defined below. The object of the class Holiday represents a holiday
  during the year. This class has three instance variables:
    • name, which is a String representing the name of the holiday
    • day, which is an int representing the day of the month of the holiday
    • month, which is a String representing the month the holiday is in

1. Write a constructor for the class Holiday, which takes a String representing the name, an int
  representing the day, and a String representing the month as its arguments, and sets the class
  variables to these values.

2. Write a method inSameMonth, which compares two instances of the class Holiday, and returns
  the Boolean value true if they have the same month, and false if they do not.
  
3. Write a piece of code that creates a Holiday instance with the name “Independence Day”, with
  the day “4”, and with the month “July”. Create another Holiday instance with the name “Labor
  Day”, with the day “5”, and with the month “September”.

4. Test your class in the main program by calling the function inSameMonth using the two instances
  created of the class Holiday
