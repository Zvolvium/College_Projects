RAID - Kills hard drives dead.

For this assignment you will write a program that simulates
a 5-disk RAID system. There will be five files (each a simulation
of a drive) that contain character-stripped data. These files
are named as follows:
   drive1.data
   drive2.data
   drive3.data
   drive4.data
   drive5.data

drive1.data will contain characters, for example:
   16af

drive2.data will contain characters, for example:
   27bg

drive3.data will contain characters, for example:
   38ch

drive4.data will contain characters, for example:
   49di

drive5.data will contain characters, for example:
   50ej

Your main program must spawn 5 threads, where each thread will 
read from one hard drive (thread 1 reads from drive 1, etc). These
threads must be "detached" and free to read data as they wish. 
As a thread reads a character from a drive (data MUST be read 
character by character) it must pass that datum (character) back 
to the main program which then must assemble the stripped data 
into a single block of data.

Once all of the data has been read in the main program must display
the assembled block of data. So for the above example you would 
display:

   1234567890abcdefghij

CAVEATS:
--------
1. You do not know how big the data files will be, but they will 
be of equal size. There will not be blank spaces in the data files.

2. Since the threads are detached, you MUST use a mutex(s) to 
synchronize them.

REQUIREMENTS:
-------------
1. This MUST run on the SERVER (cscluster.cs.und.edu).
2. Your full name must appear as a comment at the beginning of your program.
3. Your source code must be named hw6-yourname.c or hw6-yourname.cpp
4. Your program must only use mutex(s) for synchronization. No conditionals, 
   no semaphores, no global variables.
5. Your program must use pthreads. Not threads.
6. Failure to follow the above will result in -50% of the grade.
