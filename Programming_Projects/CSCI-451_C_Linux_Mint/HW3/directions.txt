HW-3	CS451	10 points	Due: Sept. 26

Write a C/C++ program that uses the PTHREAD library to create 2 threads
and mutexes to synchronize them. The program must to the following:

* MAIN will open a file (hw3.out) for writing, then call thread #1 and 
  thread #2. MAIN will also close the file when thread #1 and thread 
  #2 are finished.

* THREAD #1 will open a file (hw3.in) for reading, will read 1 integer 
  value from the file, and put that value in a global variable. Thread #1
  will then wait for thread #2 (use mutexes to control the wait) before 
  moving on to the next value (in hw3.in).

* THREAD #2 will read the global variable. If the global variable is odd, 
  thread #2 will simply write the value to hw3.out. If the global variable 
  is even thread #2 will write the value to hw3.out TWICE.

Requirements:
-------------
1. The hw3.in file will have the format of "integer" "linefeed". If you do not 
abide by the input format and my program cannot test your program will my inputs
it will be considered wrong. No exceptions! Thus, I suggest you use the command
"fscanf(file, "%d\n", &value1)" to read your *.in files. For example:
1
2
3
3
6

2. Hw3.out must have the exact format of "integer" "linefeed" as the *.in files 
will be very long and I will have a program that runs through your output files 
checking results. If you do not abide by the output format and my program cannot 
test your output it will be considered wrong. No exceptions! Thus, I suggest 
you use the command "fprintf(file, "%d\n", value)" to write your hw3.out file. 
For example:
1
2
2
3
3
6
6

REQUIREMENTS:
-------------
1. Your program must run on the Linux Mint machines in Engineering.
2. Your full name must appear as a comment at the beginning of your program.
3. Your source code must be named hw3-yourname.c or hw3-yourname.cpp
4. Your source MUST compile using gcc or g++ in accordance with the extension. 
5. Failure to follow the above directions will result in loss of points.
